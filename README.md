<h1>Hello! Iâ€™m Clement P. and I'm a Creative Developer !</h1>

Based in France, I am passionate about creative development, particularly in crafting immersive and interactive web experiences.
I specialize in using GSAP to bring dynamic animations and micro-interactions to life, enhancing user engagement and storytelling.
My curiosity and drive for innovation have led me to explore cutting-edge technologies like Three.js, which I am actively learning.
