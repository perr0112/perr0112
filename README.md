<h1>Clement P., Creative Developer</h1>

Based in France, I am passionate about creative development, particularly in crafting immersive and <br />
interactive web experiences. I specialize in using GSAP to bring dynamic animations and <br />
micro-interactions to life, enhancing user engagement and storytelling. My curiosity and drive for <br />
innovation have led me to explore cutting-edge technologies like Three.js, which I am actively learning. <br />
